        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in our
        solar system. Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. It's
        surrounded by a beautiful ring system. It's the farthest planet from Earth
        discovered by the unaided human eye.
