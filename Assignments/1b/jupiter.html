        Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system. It's similar to a star, but it
        never got massive enough to start burning. It is covered in swirling cloud stripes. It
        has big storms like the Great Red Spot, which has been going for hundreds of years.
        Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface. It is still unclear if deeper
        down, Jupiter has a central core of solid material or if it may be a thick, super-hot
        and dense soup. Jupiter also has rings, but they're too faint to see very well
