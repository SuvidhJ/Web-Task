        The sphere or spheroid-shaped Earth is the third planet in the solar system
        and is the only life-supporting planet. When seen from the Earthâ€™s outer surface, it
        looks blue in colour due to the presence of water and hence is called the blue planet.
        The Earth provides all its inhabitants with the basic amenities which are required
        for survival. The sad fact is that human beings have been exploiting all the resources
        which have been made available to us all this while mindlessly. If this continues, we
        will put ourselves and all living things in great danger. It is high time we took steps
        to save our planet. Afforestation, using biodegradable products and reducing
        pollution are some measures you could take to preserve the beauty and quality of
        life on Earth.
