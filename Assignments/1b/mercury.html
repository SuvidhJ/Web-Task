        Mercury, the innermost planet of the solar system and the eighth in size and
        mass. Its closeness to the Sun and its smallness make it the most elusive of the
        planets visible to the unaided eye. Because its rising or setting is always within about
        two hours of the Sun's, it is never observable when the sky is fully dark. Mercury is
        designated by the symbol.
