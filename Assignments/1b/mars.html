        Mars is no place for the faint-hearted. It's dry, rocky, and bitter cold. The
        fourth planet from the Sun, Mars, is one of Earth's two closest planetary neighbors
        (Venus is the other). Mars is one of the easiest planets to spot in the night sky â€” it
        looks like a bright red point of light.
