        Uranus is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is
        Neptune). Most (80% or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid
        of "icy" materials – water, methane, and ammonia – above a small rocky core. Near
        the core, it heats up to 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit (4,982 degrees Celsius).
